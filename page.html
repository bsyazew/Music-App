        There is even a scientific reason as to why music makes us feel so
        great!
        <br />
        <br />
        Our favorite melodies release dopamine, known as the feel-good hormone,
        which activates our brain's pleasure and reward system. Music can have a
        positive, immediate impact on our mental state; fast tempos can
        psychologically and physiologically arouse us, helping energize us for
        the day.
